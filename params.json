For the average person, contextual technology is becoming more and more impacting in their lives. Whether it's social media applications asking them to make a post in the event of a disaster so that their family knows they're ok to a simple \"I'm at the coffee shop!\" post.\r\n\r\n### Our application\r\nWe have developed a solution that enables any university to reliably relay information to their students through an application that once it detects a beacon, it will notify the user. The information will be a tap away.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Eddystone-URL support\r\n* Eddystone-EID support\r\n* Configurable, just declare what URL the application should look after\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created by Mario Canul under Debasis Bhattacharya from a grant from the National Science Foundation\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf there are any questions or concerns, please email mcanul@hawaii.edu\r\n",
