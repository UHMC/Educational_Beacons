  "body": "### Our application\r\nWe are working on a solution that will enable any university to reliably relay information to their students through an application. Once it detects a beacon, it will notify the user -- contextually relevant information will be a tap away.\r\n\r\nThe application can also be configured to work with a school's website; however, information on the website would need to be maintained in order for the app to stay relevant. This can be done through any web service. An example can be seen below:\r\n![A wordpress website](http://i.imgur.com/wvWnMGm.png)\r\n\r\nThe application also takes advantage of Eddystone-EID for two-factor authentication. This requires the user to be near a beacon transmitting Ephemeral Identifiers and successfully resolve it in order to become authorized to access a location. \r\n\r\n### Proposed features\r\n* Eddystone-URL support (insecure)\r\n* Configurable; just declare what URL the application should look for\r\n\r\n* Eddystone-EID support (secure)\r\n* Using Eddystone-EID, information can be catered to students based on location as a second layer of security\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n* Eddystone-URL: Application can be configured with a URL distributed by a beacon, which will notify the user that they are near it with a notification.\r\n![Configuration page](http://i.imgur.com/CWsdZxv.png)\r\n![Notification bar](http://i.imgur.com/KhJRrpu.png)\r\n* Eddystone-EID: Using available hardware by Accent beacons, we were able to successfully resolve Eddystone-EID packets and authenticate users.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created by Mario Canul and Saxon Knight under Debasis Bhattacharya with a grant from the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf there are any questions or concerns, please email mcanul@hawaii.edu or knight7@hawaii.edu",
